# Purpose 

The purpose of this project is to create a webpage using JavaScript, HTML, and Bootstrap, which will allow for users to search UFO sightings based on specific criteria. 

## Results 

Using the search criteria is very simple. It only requires users to enter the appropriate criteria in the correct seearch box and in the correct format. A placeholder was used to indicate what the correct format is. There are five possible search criteria: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. 

Searching for specific date (1/4/2010):

## Summary 

One drawback of the design of this webpage is that users must be aware of the various options when searching. For example, if a user wishes to search by city, they must first be aware of which cities have reported sightings of UFOs. Incluidng an interactive map would make it easier for users by allowing them to select cities rather than typing in the name themselves. The same map can include a legend that lists the possible search options for Date, City, State, Country and Shape.
